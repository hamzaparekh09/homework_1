Recommandation: I would say they have to invest more in the property and lands and also do a small businesses, so it would be benefcial for them and for their company. Thier stock price will go high and so their revenue.

When we have to send the money to somnone we have to write the checks, Now we can just send the money through alot of apps like zells, paypal, cash app and etc.
